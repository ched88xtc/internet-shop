# About
This is an example of an online store with basic and simple functionality. The main features of this online store include:

- Product Selection: Users are able to choose a product from a list of available products.

- Shopping Cart: Users can add selected products to their shopping cart. The shopping cart page displays the products that have been added, allowing users to review their selections. Products are stored in localStorage so that the user does not lose information when refreshing the page

- Placing an Order: The shopping cart page also includes a form for placing an order. Users can provide the necessary information to complete the purchase process.

- Quantity Adjustment: Users have the option to adjust the quantity of products in their shopping cart before placing the order. This allows them to modify the quantity of individual items as needed.

- Authorization: The project includes an implementation of user authorization. This means that users are required to log in or provide relevant credentials to access certain features or complete the purchasing process.
